# MIS301-WEB-PROGRAMMING --> 'World Cuisine' Web Site

  My name is Emine Çatlı. While designing this site, I tried to apply what I learned this year. I created the World Cuisine website by blending what I learned from the projects we did for other courses and the special notes of the MIS301 course. The purpose of this site is to be a special site for the most famous dishes from the most famous cuisines in the world, not every dish in the world. Another feature that makes this site special is that people can request special cuisines or recipes through membership. If it becomes a website that is desired to be developed in the future, this feature can provide many benefits and show the data demand from high to low with a special database. 

  I created a total of 4 HTML, 2 CSS, and 1 JavaScript files, except for the codes that I did not use as ready-made templates. I used Visual Studio Code program in my project.
  
  If we talk about some special programs and tools that I use;
  
  •	AOS: I used animate on scroll, so we see that an animation is added while scrolling on the homepage.
  
  •	SWIPER: Swiper, the most modern free mobile touch slider. It is very efficient to use on mobile websites, mobile web applications and mobile native/hybrid applications. If we want to create an application, we can use Swiper which is part of Framework.
  
  •	REMIXICON and BOOTSTRAP ICONS: Since it will be difficult to add symbols one by one in future developments, I added the free Remix Icon and boot strap icons set code via CSS.
  
  •	GLIGHTBOX: I used Lightbox codes in CSS and JavaScript part. We use this to make the photos enlarge when we click on them.
  
  •	ISOTOPE-LAYOUT: I used the Isotope Library. With this tool, we can easily classify the food images on the website. In this way, by clicking on the tabs that we will create as categories, we will be able to display the contents of each tab, that is, its visuals, animated.
  
  •	PURE COUNTER: I added pure counter with JavaScript. In this way, when we open our recipe site, the menu pictures can change with the counter countdown.
  
  •	PHP-EMAIL: I added a mail link to JavaScript via Php. You can directly connect to the e-mail.
  
  •	BOX ICON: I added box icon codes for the writing and membership areas.
  
  •	BOOTSTRAP: That my website can be displayed to ensure that the map I have added can be displayed in this way.
